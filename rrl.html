        <div class="single-page-project-description">
        <p class="description-paragraph">Rutherford Rocket Labs is a client led, group project where our team needed to meet the ever changing requirements given to or negotiated from our client over a 4 day period.  The ultimate goal being inventory tracking software for a rocket manufacturing warehouse.</p>

        <p class="description-paragraph">This was the first time we were ever tasked to create a product for someone other than ourselves - which proved tricker than it sounds because clients have ever changing needs, expectations, and may not be techincal enough in nature to explain the functionality they are trying to obtain.  The project began with a client Q+A session where we learned as much as we could about the clients process, how the software would be used, and who would be using it.  Next we whipped up some simple wireframes and iterated over them until they were signed off by the client - and then we began to build.  We followed agile methodology while working in vertical slices to accomplish each task, meeting in with the client every morning and mid-afternoon.

        </div>

        <p class="description-paragraph"><highlight>What I learned</highlight> from this project is the importance of having a vision and planning each step one thing at a time.  Having a wireframe to work towards was incredibly helpful and made sure everyone on the team had the save idea of what the final product should look like.  Engaging with a client who was non-technical was maybe the most educational - helping me learn more effective ways of communicating and still being able to get my ideas across.</p>
