        <div class="single-page-project-description">
        <p class="description-paragraph">FeelFree is a group project completed in less than one week while at DevBootcamp in October.  The task assigned to us was to create a web application that would utilize our skills learned through the program while also challenging us to implement technologies that we hadn’t yet touched, a goal that would likely mimic real world scenarios when building new software.</p>

        <p class="description-paragraph">Led by a team lead, the idea was spawned by a team member who, while living in chicago would attend events with her male co-workers, but often left the establishments feeling upset or disappointed in the way she was treated by staff of that establishment, and more so not being taken seriously when she had an issue.  The idea was to help provide a platform where individuals could seek out establishments that took reports of sexual harassment and unfair treatment seriously, which would help them feel safe.<p/>

        <div class="technology-used">
          <span><highlight>Languages:</highlight> Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery</span>
          <span><highlight>Frameworks:</highlight> Ruby on Rails</span>
          <span><highlight>Technologies:</highlight> Rspec, CircleCI, Dropbox, Heroku, PostgreSQL, GoogleMaps API, Yelp API</span>
        </div>

        <p class="description-paragraph"><highlight>What I learned</highlight> from this project was far more valuable than the outcome.  While we ended up with a fully functioning product, I learned firsthand the importance of communication between your team members.  Working in vertical slices and utilizing a kanban board helped drive the process, but checking in with team member regularly and daily standups were far more important. This helped push us through areas where anyone was stuck.  I also learned how difficult the decisions around software are - questions like “What do we give users access to?”, “How much information should we make public?”, “Is this offensive to anyone?”, “How do we direct the conversation?”.  All of these were difficult to navigate, and better helped shape my perspective on building software.</p>
