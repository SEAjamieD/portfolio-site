        <p class="description-paragraph">This was the first website I made with DBC, during week 3 after studying HTML and CSS.  I went back later and added just a hint of JavaScript to it for good measure.
        </p>

        <p class="description-paragraph">The basic idea of the assignment was to simply pick something and make a website on it that would allow us to use a number of different skills that we had learned thus far.  I chose to design my site around camping in La Push, Washington, because I had just recently visited for a big birthday party camping trip.<p/>

        <div class="technology-used">
          <span><highlight>Languages:</highlight> HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery</span>
        </div>

        <p class="description-paragraph"><highlight>What I learned</highlight> while making this site is that there is so much more code i'll get to discover.  I learned how to optimize images for faster site loading and that centering is a pain!  Since making this site, I've gone deeper into JavaScript (which has become my favorite language) and am learning as much as I possibly can.  Front End Development is my absolute favoite type of code and I soak up any front end information around me like a sponge.</p>
